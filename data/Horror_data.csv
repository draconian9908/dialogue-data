passenger liner north island   Passenger vessel "Chimera" I will  Roger North Island Arctic Warrior  With a little extra fuel weather  The law's on our side If they want  Either way we found it It's

cargo's  It looks like it We leave it where it is Stick to  So we get a little more for the boat  It's worth the effort Believe me   For now the best thing we can do is  Dodge you gotta get on those repairs The sooner we get under way the  Terrific How's that leg We could call for help to radio Roger that North Island Arctic  Not much at all I guess Retire   How about you Epps Greer Dreamin's all

Diary VO Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World We have had it in our possession for about six months but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ We saw a gateway through the clouds Everything was full of peace and bliss We then realised we had the key    Diary V0 We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World Only about 10 people have it On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of    Diary VO    on this Day of Finding the Key to the Way

night It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis too I'm not hungry I just want to be on my own for a while Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away But she'll have no one

To think that so much could happen in so little time caused by so few A terrible tragedy has occurred    Theatrical voice "Now gels    it isn't ooo it's eee" and she goes    "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her Silly old trout And then in history we've got this senile old bat who goes    Squawky voice "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was

Diary VO Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake which I thought was somewhat unfair She has brought up the worst possible threat now She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again The thought is too dreadful Life would be unbearable without Deborah    Diary VO l wish I could die This is not an idle or temporary impulse I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together and the thought of death is not fearsome Diary VO My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year so there is more probability of my keeping it It is to make my motto "Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow you may be dead" My name is Gina What does old Stew want Who cares I'm educating myself Scornful What do you know You wouldn't know the first thing about writing You're the most ignorant person I've ever met Shouting I don't wanna be in bloody school I think I'm going crazy Let's go overseas    OS Stay still or they'll be blurry    OS Just a couple more    Whispers I'm sure they'll notice things missing I can try my father's safe I'm sure I can get the keys

arrived Diary VO Dr Hulme asked us to come into the lounge to have a talk with him Diary VO The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind It is so incredible Poor Father Dr Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding    Diary VO He said we must tell him everything about our going to America He was both hopegiving and depressing We talked for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was over Diary VO What is to be the future now We may all be going to Italy and dozens of other places or not all We none of us know where we are and a good deal depends on chance Diary VO Dr Hulme is the noblest and most wonderful person I have ever known of Diary VO One thing Deborah and I are sticking to through everything we sink or swim together Intense The Hulmes will look after me They want me to live with them I belong with Deborah We're going to South Africa Intense You have to let me go Diary VO I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide Life seems so much not worth the living death such an easy way out Diary VO Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me If she were to die    Upset It's no bloody good    I went to the passport office today They won't give me one till I'm 20 Choked up I need my sodding parents' consent Diary VO I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal I am trying to think of some way Diary VO We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do It is because we are MAD We are both stark raving MAD Diary VO Dr Hulme is MAD as MAD as a March hare Diary VO It was the first time I had ever seen It Deborah had always told me how hideous he was Diary VO It is appalling He is dreadful I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness    but I adore him Diary VO We talked for some time about It getting ourselves more and more excited Diary VO We enacted how each saint would make love in bed Diary VO We spent a hectic night going through the saints It was wonderful Heavenly Beautiful And ours We felt satisfied indeed We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss the joy of the thing called Sin I'm coming with you I know what to do about mother We don't want to go to too much trouble    some sort of accident People die every day Diary VO Our main idea for the day was to moider mother Diary VO This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea Naturally we feel a trifle nervous but the pleasure of anticipation is great Diary VO We both spent last night having a simply wonderful time in every possible way Diary VO I was picked up at 200 PM I have been very sweet and good I have worked out a little more of our plan Peculiarly enough I have no qualms of conscience Diary VO I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag We discussed the moider fully I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead How oddyet how pleasing Mummy Diary VO I am writing a little of this up on the morning before the death I felt very excited and the nightbeforeChristmasish last night I am about to rise Let's go upstairs Deborah I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night It's a threeact story with a tragic end I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal       but in the end I decided against it I thought it would spoil all their fun It's true He was spotted in the lingerie department eh Wendy I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom and they have to pretend to be on some mountain Bye Dad Let's go for a walk down here    come on Mummy Gently
